# Alexnet Preprocessing

## Description

The objective is to determine whether incorporating a preprocessing layer derived from PhyCV, the first physics-inspired computer vision framework, will enhance the performance of a machine learning model. Specifically, the model in question is based on AlexNet architecture, and its current implementation uses the CIFAR-10 dataset. The educated hypothesis is that the unique physics-based transformations and algorithms provided by PhyCV could reduce noise, extract features more effectively, or otherwise improve image classification accuracy. This study will measure improvements in performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, or computational efficiency after the integration of PhyCV's preprocessing methods.
